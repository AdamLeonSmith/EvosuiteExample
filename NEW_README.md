## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project is an implementation of the popular Calculator app with a GUI that resembles the iPhone design and colours and currently supports basic operations and nested expression calculus that contains the following operations:
- addition
- difference
- multiplication
- division

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
To check if you already have the requirements
run the following command(cmd/linux terminal):
- for __Java__: ``` java --version```
- for __Maven__: ``` mvn --version ```

If you don't have the requirements above mentioned you should follow the following links to install them:
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html)

### Installing
To run the app you should follow the next steps, after installing the requirements. In the root folder of the project type:

```
mvn install
```

If the above command succeeds you should have a new folder called target after this to run the app you should type:
```
mvn exec:java
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
To run the unit-tests on your local computer type the following command: ```mvn test```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
After running the ```mvn exec:java``` command you should be ready to use the Calculator app developed in this project.
