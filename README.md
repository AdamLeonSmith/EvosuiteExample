* A simple Java Calculator made for fun that can calculate expressions using my own version of Shunting-yard 
 algorithm.The GUI was made with Java Swing.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
* To run the project you must have jdk installed.To check if you already have it run the following command:
```
java -help
```

### Installing
* If you don't have the jdk you can install it using the following command:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```

## Running
To run the application open the terminal on the project ***src*** folder and use the following command:
```
make build
```
after this just double click on the ***Calculator.jar***

## Built With
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -  is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on  your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in  support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).
